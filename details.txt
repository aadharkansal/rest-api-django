This is a django REST-API with Auth system 
It has two user auth system made for nursery and customer.
URL -   BASE_URL/customer/signup/
        BASE_URL/nursery/signup/
        BASE_URL/login/
        BASE_URL/logout/

I made REST API using django rest frameworks and used generic views.
API Endpoins -  /plants/          - GET - displays all plants.
                                    POST - Add new plants.
                /plants/<int:pk>  - GET - Shows specific plant with ID as pk.
                                    PUT - Updates specific plant with ID as pk.
                /orders_view/     - GET - shows all orders.
                /orders/          - POST - create new orders.

NOTE :  This is a full backend service and doesnot contains any template although it has forms for login and signup.
        Used SQlite as DB to see the database create admin superuser then login BASE_URL/admin/ with credentials.
        On running the server you wouldn't be able to views html pages. 
        To test the server you can use postman to make API calls.
